The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third-party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave our mobile product you are using and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Cinamon Games. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color:#333333">Our Services may contain third-party tracking and data collection and analytics tools from our Partners, examples of which include AppsFlyer (https://www.appsflyer.com). Such third parties may use APIs and SDKs in our Services to enable them to collect and analyze user and device related data and information. The third parties may have access to and collect data and information about you, such as your device identifier, geo-location information, IP address, application usage, access and session times, applications present on the device or in use at a particular time on the device, and your viewing of and interactions with advertising, for the purpose of providing their services, including, for example, enabling, providing and delivering advertising as described in further detail below.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color:#333333">The privacy policies of our Partners may include additional terms and disclosures regarding their data collection and use practices and tracking technologies, and we encourage you to check those privacy policies to learn more about their data collection and use practices, use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color:#333333">We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</span></p>
