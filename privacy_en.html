        <p>
        </p>
        <p>We may provide your non-identifiable information to our "Affiliates" (which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership located in the United States, Japan or anywhere else in the

            directly shared your personal information to us or the third party. Such third party service providers may have access to your personally identifiable information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose
            or use it for any other purpose. </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>In the event Company combines with another company in the future through a corporate merger, sale, acquisition, liquidation or other similar process, your non-identifiable information may be transferred with the business or a part of it to the
            successor organization in such transaction. If material changes to the Company’s privacy practices will occur as a result of such a transaction, we will notify you and other users in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>In addition, upon the expiration or a termination of any third party license arrangements involving one or more parts of the Service, your non-identifiable information (including device, log, location, and game-related user information) may be
            transferred to the subject third party licensor in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement. In advance of such transfer to a third party licensor, the Company will notify you and other users in writing in the manner described
            in this Privacy Policy. </p>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>VI. Third Party Sites and Collection and Use of Information by Third Parties
        </h4>
        <p>Our website and mobile products may contain advertising or services which link to other websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation
            with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site, including on an advertisement, you will leave our mobile product you are using and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties,
            we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Cinamon Games. We encourage you to review the privacy
            policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. </p>
        <p>
            Our Services may contain third-party tracking and data collection and analytics tools from our Partners, examples of which include AppsFlyer (https://www.appsflyer.com). Such third parties may use APIs and SDKs in our Services to enable them to collect
            and analyze user and device related data and information. The third parties may have access to and collect data and information about you, such as your device identifier, geo-location information, IP address, application usage, access and
            session times, applications present on the device or in use at a particular time on the device, and your viewing of and interactions with advertising, for the purpose of providing their services, including, for example, enabling, providing
            and delivering advertising as described in further detail below.</p>

        <p>The privacy policies of our Partners may include additional terms and disclosures regarding their data collection and use practices and tracking technologies, and we encourage you to check those privacy policies to learn more about their data
            collection and use practices, use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies.</p>

        <p>To the extent we display advertising in our Services, we may allow advertising networks of our affiliates and Partner networks to collect information about your mobile device to enable them to serve targeted ads to you. </p>

        <p>You may also limit data collection by third parties by using your mobile device settings. Please note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertising from appearing in your application. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
            Additionally, please note that if you use a different mobile device or erase cache from your application, you may need to renew your opt-out choices.</p>

        <br>

        <h4>VII. Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information </h4>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate
            business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical
            (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes). </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.
            Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>VIII. HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA </h4>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Security Safeguards. </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Data retention. </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We will for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data. </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>IX. AGE-RELATED DISCLOSURE </h4>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Our terms require that all our users be the age of 17 or above. Thus, please note that this Section is provided herein for the purpose of complying with the applicable laws and regulations only. </p>

        <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 13, please do not send any data about
            yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal data. If we learn that we have collected personal data about teenagers under age 13, we will delete that
            data as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any data from or about teenagers under the age of 13, please contact us. We also do not sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</p>
        <p>
